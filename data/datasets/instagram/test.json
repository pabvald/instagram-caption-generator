        "  i wanted to do this for so long now and share my story to my followers and give back the love   \ud83c\udffb   and the hashtag with encouraged me to share   so    at 3 months old i was given up for fostering due to my birth mother having addiction problems during her pregnancy with me   i was fostered for about 6 months and then adopted at 8 months    growing up was hard for me because as a young boy in primary school trying to explain why i had two family trees and two   tummy mummies   was tough as i myself didn  t really understand what that meant   after many awkward and tough encounters with family members i decided to tell one of my closet friends my story   this was when i was entering high school   this person decided to tell others my story and this destroyed me   everyone knew and was bothering me and teasing me and i felt so isolated   this led to years of bullying and trying to hide myself   me being insecure and angry    i used to get so angry and confused and just wanted to be normal    so frustrated with the concept of trying to blend in   i was obsessed with the idea of being normal and this led to me retreating into myself    building walls in my friendships so i didn  t get hurt so easily    adoption is such an amazing thing and personally i feel like there isnt enough publicity for me and my fellow peers that are adopted    this is the reason im doing this    i want people that are adopted to know i understand you and its okay      recently ive learned that what others tell me i am   and that my insecurities and my struggles   i am so blessed to have this life i live and have realised that god has got my life all planned out   i want to just say be you    don  t live for anyone else   be happy   be confident and love yourself   thank you for reading   \ud83d\udccb     thank you for sharing this very inspirational and beautiful   "
