        "a victim of rape im a survivor this is my story with domestic violence being such a big issue in australia at the moment i thought i would share my story in hope that it will inspire at least one person to get help i was with my ex partner for just over a year things were greatat the start until he got addicted and started to rely heavily on the drug crystal meth thats when things started to get abusive and extremely violent and i started to lie to my friends that i wasnt seeing him because they knew how abusive he was i had to cover marks and bruises with make up i refused to believe that he was an unstable person and believed that i could change him but i couldnt one day we went out to a club and he drugged me i woke up tied to a bed and was gang raped by him and 7 other people he made me believe that i deserved the abuse and i would take it towards the end of the relationship he called me telling me to go to his house because there was some type of emergency i went and found him having sexual intercourse with another male that should have been the end of it right though a couple weeks later he texted me saying to meet me at his house because he wanted to apologise for everything that he didstupidly i went as soon as i arrived he grabbed the back of my head and smashed it into a brick wall whilst choking me he forced himself on me i didnt tell my parents about the abuse until about a year later and told my friends that i managed to get him off me because thats what i wanted to believe though no one should be ashamed of domestic violence and rape its never your fault and you should always speak up and help is out there if you have experienced and are going through something similar please dont hesitate to seek help if you would like support and someone to talk to dont hesitate to call beyondblue support service on 1300 22 46 36 if you are in an emergency call 000 straight away and ask for police never think your alone and help isnt available your not a victim your a survivor depression anxiety ptsd "

        "proud of you too  my weight from my freshman year of high school to my junior year i went from being a healthy 56 and 120 pounds to being 80 pounds i was struggling through my parents divorce and a really bad breakup it led to anorexia which was one of the hardest things in my life to overcome so far i was so skinny if i laid down you could see and feel my organs in my stomach at the same time i was dealing with so much anxiety and depression that i could not even think straight i hope no one ever has to go through the same struggles as myself because of my anorexia my family became concerned for me and instead of them trying to find help for me they just pointed out my obvious weight loss to the point where i would feel even worse about myself all these issues caused me to become extremely ill by my junior year and i was hospitalized 4 or 5 times that year do to malnutrition something snapped in me by the end of my junior year to the point where i just had to change myself or my life was going to go down the drain i have gained my weight back to 120 but now i have to go through the struggle of people pointing out my weight gain they are mostly good comments but i still struggle at seeing myself at the weight i want to be i look at pictures of myself from 4 years ago and say man i was skinny then and then i have to remind myself no i was unhealthy trying to see myself as healthy is hard but i am thankful for my friends who helped me out of the bad place i was in i hope this helps others who are struggling with similar issues as mine "
